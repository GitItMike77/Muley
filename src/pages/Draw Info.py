2. General Deer - Full Price Draw
3. Limited Quota - Special Draw
4. Limited Quota - Full Price Draw
5. Leftover Licenses
                
The Special Draw is set of permits reserved for those willing to pay more for better draw odds.
As of 2025, the Special Draw cost about 3x as much as the Full Price Draw. The General Deer permit
allows you to apply for a region, which is a collection of hunt areas. The Limited Quota permit is
is specific to an individual hunt area which has limited quota for deer harvest, making it harder to draw.
You **cannot** hunt Limited Quota hunt areas with a General Deer permit.
